Description: metapackage for installing the basic KDE Telepathy components
 KDE Telepathy aims to integrate real-time communication and collaboration
 features into the KDE Plasma Workspaces. It provides means to connect
 to several instant messaging networks, chat with your friends and
 collaborate with them.
 .
 KDE Telepathy consists of several independent components that need to be
 used together to provide all the available features. This package is
 a metapackage that installs the most basic components, for the most simple
 use case. For installing all the components, use the kde-telepathy
 metapackage.
 .
 Apart from the dependencies that this metapackage pulls, you will also
 need to install at least one of the telepathy-gabble, telepathy-salut,
 telepathy-haze packages to be able to connect to your IM networks.
 gabble provides xmpp (jabber, google talk/plus, facebook), salut provides
 link-local xmpp (using avahi) and haze provides most other common protocols.
